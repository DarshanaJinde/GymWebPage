                <p class="text-norm">BTS (Korean: 방탄소년단; RR: Bangtan Sonyeondan), also known as the Bangtan Boys, is a
                    seven-member South Korean boy band that began formation in 2010 and debuted in 2013 under Big Hit
                    Entertainment. The septet—composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook—co-writes and
                    co-produces much of their own output. Originally a hip hop group, their musical style has evolved to
                    include a wide range of genres. <br>
                    Their lyrics, often focused on personal and social commentary, touch
                    on the themes of mental health, troubles of school-age youth and coming-of-age, loss, the journey
                    towards loving oneself, and individualism. Their work features references to literature and
                    psychological concepts and includes an alternative universe storyline.

                <p class="text-norm">First unveiled in March of 2016, the BTS LOVE YOURSELF series creates a narrative
                    by linking the key songs in each album into a single theme, imparting the message that “loving
                    yourself is true love”. Like a well-written novel having introduction, development, twists, and
                    conclusion it shared a compelling story for two and a half years.<br><br>

                    ‘ANSWER’ is the final piece of the puzzle. Though it’s a repackaged album, LOVE YOURSELF 結 ‘ANSWER’
                    still includes seven brand-new tracks. CD A is a concept album, its sixteen tracks all connected
                    lyrically to highlight BTS’ prowess as both artists and storytellers.</p>

                <p class="heading">DARK & WILD</p>
                <p class="text-norm">In their first studio album in a year and two months, BTS sings about love gone
                    awry in DARK & WILD. They warn the girl who acts like she doesn't love them not to test their love
                    anymore.<br><br>

                    The boys are no longer in their school uniforms. They have become tougher, singing that their love
                    is not to be treated lightly. A year and two months into their debut, BTS made sure that the
                    visuals, performance and all the elements of their first studio album are flawless. Tracks that
                    highlight the different genres of hip hop—South, West, Boom Bap and Trap—provide a clear direction
                    of BTS' music. The title track “Danger” is a tightly-composed hybrid hip hop song with a piercing
                    punk-rock guitar sound that features stark rap, a powerful hook and exhilarating shouting.

                    BTS is returning with their new album BE to unfold another chapter of 2020.<br><br>

                    As a sense of helplessness looms in every corner of the world, BTS opens themselves up to express
                    their mixed feelings about this situation—fear and anxiety mingled with the determination to
                    overcome all this. The album consists of a total of eight tracks including the No.1 summer hit
                    “Dynamite” and lead single “Life Goes On”. The latter speaks on behalf of everyone stuck in the new
                    normality brought on by COVID-19: one day, the world stopped without any warning, streets erased of
                    footsteps and the way out is nowhere near in sight. BTS echoes in a low voice the comforting message
                    that in the face of unexpected turns “Life Goes On” and extends their hands towards the future.</p>

                    “We can laugh if we are together”, a message of comfort and hope to the youth of this generation.
                    <br><br>
                    YOU NEVER WALK ALONE completes the stories of youth and growth that could not all be contained in
                    the WINGS album. Whereas The most beautiful moment in life series and WINGS were narratives of youth
                    and growth, this additional chapter to WINGS is a message of warm consolation and hope for the
                    suffering youth of this generation.
